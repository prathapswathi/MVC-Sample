&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ER DIAGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Entity&amp;ndash;relationship model (ER model)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes the structure of a database with the help of a diagram, which is known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)&lt;/strong&gt;. An ER model is a design or blueprint of a database that can later be implemented as a database. The main components of E-R model are: entity set and relationship set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ER diagram shows the relationship among entity sets. An entity set is a group of similar entities and these entities can have attributes. In terms of DBMS, an entity is a table or attribute of a table in database, so by showing relationship among tables and their attributes, ER diagram shows the complete logical structure of a database. Lets have a look at a simple ER diagram to understand this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A simple ER Diagram:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following diagram we have two entities Student and College and their relationship. The relationship between Student and College is many to one as a college can have many students however a student cannot study in multiple colleges at the same time. Student entity has attributes such as Stu_Id, Stu_Name &amp;amp; Stu_Addr and College entity has attributes such as Col_ID &amp;amp; Col_Name.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the geometric shapes and their meaning in an E-R Diagram. We will discuss these terms in detail in the next section(Components of a ER Diagram) of this guide so don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about these terms now, just go through them once.&lt;/p&gt;
